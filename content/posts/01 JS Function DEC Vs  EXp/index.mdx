# JS Function Declaration Vs Function Expression

There are four or more ways to write functions, but here we’re going to look at two ways of creating functions.  
A Function Declaration is always hoisted before the function is executed. It is the most used method to declare a function in Javascript using function keyword followed by its function name, then parenthesis and body of code written inside curly braces.  


Example:  	

	function sum (x, y) { 		
		console.log( x + y); 	}  

To call or invoke a function, use its function name. E.g sum()    


A Function Expression is determined by a function keyword, followed by an optional function name, a pair of parenthesis ( ) and a pair of curly braces { }. Function expression is created when the execution reaches its code. It uses variable to declare and assigned as an anonymous function. It does not have a named function since it is stored inside a variable.  

Example:  	
	
	var sayHello = function() {
		console.log("Hello!")
	};	

Differences between Declaration and Expressions:  

*  a function declaration can be called before or after that function is declared.

* a function expression is called before it is declared it’ll throw an error.
